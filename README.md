#Pixel Canvas 
Created by [Cukia Kimani] ( http://cukiamakesgames.com )

Is a bare bones [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com) pixel editor. An entry for the [toolboxjam](https://itch.io/jam/toolbox-jam). The tool allows you to create new pixel sprites as well as edit existing pixel ones. There's the pen, eraser, and color picker. What else do you need? Save your sprites directly back into your Unity3D project and use them in your game immediately without leaving the editor.
